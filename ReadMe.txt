Instructions
------------

(1) Load the Project in VB
(2) Select Project/References, and ensure the 
    Icons4VBHelper entry is checked and not
    marked "missing". If it is, select it and
    click "Browse" - you'll find the TLB file
    in the "TypeLib" subfolder of the project.
(3) Compile
(4) Right-click the "Install.reg" file and 
    select "Merge".
(5) Open an explorer window, browse to a VB
    project folder and see the pretty icons :)

Note: On some some versions of windows, a reboot
      *may* be required after installing, before
      the proper icons will appear. Not my fault :/

To Uninstall
------------
Run the UnInstall.bat file.
